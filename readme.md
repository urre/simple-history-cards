# Simple History Cards

Card based layout for Simple History.

Simple History Cards enhances [Simple History](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-history/) by [Pär Thernström](http://eskapism.se/). It shows recent changes as cards and indicates user actions with icons. Since card based layout needs some more space, Simple History Cards will use the full width of the admin dashboard.
